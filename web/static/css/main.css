/**
 * DuilioCode Studio - CSS Architecture
 * 
 * This project uses a modular CSS architecture for maintainability.
 * Each file is loaded directly in index.html for optimal HTTP/2 performance.
 * 
 * Structure:
 * - variables.css  : Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
 * - base.css       : Reset, typography, animations
 * - layout.css     : App structure (panels, bars, tree)
 * - components.css : Reusable UI (buttons, forms, modals)
 * - editor.css     : Code editor and welcome screen
 * - chat.css       : AI chat interface
 * 
 * Guidelines:
 * - Keep files focused on one responsibility
 * - Use CSS variables for theming
 * - Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)
 * - Use BEM-like naming for components
