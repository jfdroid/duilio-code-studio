# Introduction to DuilioCode Studio

## What is DuilioCode Studio?

DuilioCode Studio is an AI-powered code assistant that runs **locally on your computer**. It understands what you want to do and can **create, modify, delete, and read files** directly, without you needing to do it manually.

## Fundamental Concepts

### 🤖 Local AI Assistant
- **No internet required**: Everything runs on your computer
- **Total privacy**: Your code never leaves your machine
- **Fast**: Doesn't depend on external server connections

### 💬 Two Conversation Modes

#### Chat Mode (Simple)
- For general questions
- Direct conversation, no file operations
- Focused interface, similar to Gemini or DeepSeek

#### Agent Mode (Advanced)
- Can **create, read, modify, and delete** files
- Understands your project context
- Accesses system information (files, folders, etc.)

### 🔧 How Does It Work?

```
You write: "create a file teste.txt with 'Hello World'"
    ↓
DuilioCode understands your intention
    ↓
Generates action code: ```create-file:teste.txt
Hello World
```
    ↓
Action Processor executes the action
    ↓
File created on your computer!
```

## Main Components

### 1. **Ollama** - AI Engine
- Local server that runs language models
- Communicates via HTTP API
- Supports various models (Qwen, Llama, etc.)

### 2. **Qwen2.5-Coder** - AI Model
- Code-specialized model
- Understands Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin, etc.
- Generates functional and correct code

### 3. **FastAPI** - Web Framework
- Creates the API that connects frontend and backend
- Manages HTTP requests
- Processes and returns responses

### 4. **Action Processor** - Action Executor
- Reads actions generated by AI
- Executes on the file system
- Validates and protects against dangerous operations

## Why Is It Useful?

### Before (Without DuilioCode)
```
1. You think: "I need to create a file teste.txt"
2. Open the editor
3. Create the file
4. Write the content
5. Save
```

### With DuilioCode
```
1. You write: "create teste.txt with 'Hello World'"
2. DuilioCode creates automatically
```

### Real Examples

**Create complete project:**
```
"create a complete React project with components"
→ DuilioCode creates package.json, src/, components, etc.
```

**Modify file:**
```
"add a validation function to the utils.js file"
→ DuilioCode reads the file, adds the function, saves
```

**List files:**
```
"what files do you see in the src folder?"
→ DuilioCode lists all project files
```

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**: Main language
- **FastAPI**: Modern and fast web framework
- **Ollama**: Local AI server
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database (SQLite)
- **JavaScript**: Frontend (Vanilla JS, no frameworks)
- **SQLite**: Local database
